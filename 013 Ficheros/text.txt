A good's price elasticity of demand is a measure of how sensitive the 
quantity demanded of it is to its price. When the price rises, 
quantity demanded falls for almost any good, but it falls more for some 
than for others. The price elasticity gives the percentage change in 
quantity demanded when there is a one percent increase in price, 
holding everything else constant. If the elasticity is -2, that 
means a one percent price rise leads to a two percent decline in 
quantity demanded. Other elasticities measure how the quantity demanded 
changes with other variables (e.g. the income elasticity of demand for 
consumer income changes).
